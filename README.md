Troposphere
===========

## Installation

### Troposphere's backend

Install the required python packages
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

A separate environment is provided for developers
```
pip install -r dev_requirements.txt
```

The `*requirements.txt` files are generated using
[pip-tools](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools). See
[REQUIREMENTS.md](REQUIREMENTS.md) for instructions on using pip-tools and
upgrading packages in Troposphere.


## Development

### Quick feedback

The `webpack-dev-server` will serve new bundles to a browser when files
change.

It has the following features:

- Changes result in a browser refresh (you know they are propagated)
- The bundle is served from memory not disk
- Small changes result in small compiles

Currently troposphere uses nginx to serve its assets. This makes it trivial to
serve these assets from the dev server.

Update your nginx definition (at `/etc/nginx/locations/tropo.conf`)
```nginx
location /assets {
    # This just needs to point to the dev server which runs on 8080
    proxy_pass https://atmo.local.cloud:8080;
}
```

Finally start the dev server:
```bash
npm run serve -- --env.host=server.example.com --env.port=8080 --env.https --env.sslCert=/path/to/cert --env.sslKey=/path/to/key
```
